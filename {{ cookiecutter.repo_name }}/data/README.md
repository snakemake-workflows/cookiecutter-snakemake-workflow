This folder is meant to contain all data.
A subfolder `data/raw` should contain all raw data to be analyzed by the workflow.
A subfolder `data/ref` should contain all reference data needed for the workflow.
Wherever feasible, the latter should be downloaded programmatically via rules defined in the pipeline.
