This folder is meant to hold all files generated during analyses conducted by the workflow.
Best practice is to have a separate folder for each analysis step and to place log files in a separate folder (`analyses/logs`).
Further, this folder could contain an `analysis/tmp` folder if you fear that the system's `tmp` might overflow from your analyses.
